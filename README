			ROX-Filer
			A RISC OS-like filer for X
			by Thomas Leonard



Quick start
~~~~~~~~~~~
Type this ($ is the shell prompt):

	$ ./install.sh

and follow the on-screen instructions. If you want to compile as a normal
user and install as root then you should do this instead:

	$ ROX-Filer/AppRun --compile
	$ su
	[ enter root password ]
	$ ./install.sh

Help for ROX-Filer can be found in the directory ROX-Filer/Help.


About the 'rox' script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a little PERL script for opening files. It will guess the type of
the file and then find a program to open it with. It is intended to be used
as part of the ROX Desktop:
	<http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~tal197/rox.php3>

Note that it requires a little setting up, but after that you can say, eg:

	$ rox Picture.gif
	(to display the picture)

	$ rox /tmp
	(shows the /tmp directory in a filer)

	$ rox
	(opens the current directory)

	$ rox -h
	(shows the help text)

To install the script, simply put it into a directory in your PATH variable.
'/usr/local/bin' is a good choice, if you have permission to write there.
The install script will do this for you.


Files
~~~~~

Two places are used for configuration files:

<Choices>/MIME-info/*
	Contains the rules for guessing a file's type from its name.
	Many programs come with files called '<prog>.mime' which contain
	additional rules. Put these files in the MIME-info directory too.

<Choices>/MIME-types/*
	Contains programs or symlinks which will be run.
	For example:

	$ rox picture.gif
	is like doing
	$ <Choices>/MIME-types/image_gif picture.gif
	or, if that isn't found,
	$ <Choices>/MIME-types/image picture.gif

In both cases, <Choices> is all the directories in your CHOICESPATH
environment variable, which defaults to:

	~/Choices:/usr/local/share/Choices:/usr/share/Choices

The leftmost directory listed is searched first, followed by the others in
order. If the string starts with a `:' then saving is disabled and no program
will attempt to save any configuration into it. For more details, see:
