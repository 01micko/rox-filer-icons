"<u>Quick Start</u>\n"
"Just put the name of the file you're looking for in single quotes:\n"
"<b>'index.html'</b> (to find a file called 'index.html')\n"
"\n"
"<u>Examples</u>\n"
"<b>'*.htm', '*.html'</b> (finds HTML files)\n"
"<b>IsDir 'lib'</b> (finds directories called 'lib')\n"
"<b>IsReg 'core'</b> (finds a regular file called 'core')\n"
"<b>! (IsDir, IsReg)</b> (is neither a directory nor a regular file)\n"
"<b>mtime after 1 day ago and size > 1Mb</b> (big, and recently modified)\n"
"<b>'CVS' prune, isreg</b> (a regular file not in CVS)\n"
"<b>IsReg system(grep -q fred \"%\")</b> (contains the word 'fred')\n"
"\n"
"<u>Simple Tests</u>\n"
"<b>IsReg, IsLink, IsDir, IsChar, IsBlock, IsDev, IsPipe, IsSocket, IsDoor</"
"b> (types)\n"
"<b>IsSUID, IsSGID, IsSticky, IsReadable, IsWriteable, IsExecutable</b> "
"(permissions)\n"
"<b>IsEmpty, IsMine</b>\n"
"A pattern in single quotes is a shell-style wildcard pattern to match. If "
"it\n"
"contains a slash then the match is against the full path; otherwise it is\n"
"against the leafname only.\n"
"\n"
"<u>Comparisons</u>\n"
"<b>&lt;, &lt;=, =, !=, &gt;, &gt;=, After, Before</b> (compare two values)\n"
"<b>5 bytes, 1Kb, 2Mb, 3Gb</b> (file sizes)\n"
"<b>2 secs|mins|hours|days|weeks|years  ago|hence</b> (times)\n"
"<b>atime, ctime, mtime, now, size, inode, nlinks, uid, gid, blocks</b> "
"(values)\n"
"\n"
"<u>Specials</u>\n"
"<b>system(command)</b> (true if 'command' returns with a zero exit status;\n"
"a % in 'command' is replaced with the path of the current file)\n"
"<b>prune</b> (false, and prevents searching the contents of a directory)."

"Normally, you can just select a command from the menu (click \n"
"on the arrow beside the command box). Sometimes, you need more...\n"
"\n"
"The format of a command is: <b>CHANGE, CHANGE, ...</b>\n"
"Each <b>CHANGE</b> is: <b>WHO HOW PERMISSIONS</b>\n"
"<b>WHO</b> is some combination of <b>u</b>, <b>g</b> and <b>o</b> which "
"determines whether to\n"
"change the permissions for the User (owner), Group or Others.\n"
"<b>HOW</b> is <b>+</b>, <b>-</b> or <b>=</b> to add, remove or set exactly "
"the permissions.\n"
"<b>PERMISSIONS</b> is some combination of the letters <b>rwxXstugo</b>\n"
"\n"
"Bracketed text and spaces are ignored.\n"
"\n"
"<u>Examples</u>\n"
"<b>u+rw</b>: the file owner gains read and write permission\n"
"<b>g=u</b>: the group permissions are set to be the same as the user's\n"
"<b>o=u-w</b>: others get the same permissions as the owner, but without "
"write permission\n"
"<b>a+x</b>: <b>a</b>ll get execute/access permission - same as <b>ugo+x</b>\n"
"<b>a+X</b>: directories become accessable by everyone; files which were\n"
"executable by anyone become executable by everyone\n"
"<b>u+rw, go+r</b>: two commands at once!\n"
"<b>u+s</b>: set the SetUID bit - often has no effect on script files\n"
"<b>755</b>: set the permissions directly\n"
