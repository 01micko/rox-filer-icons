ROX-Filer was created by Thomas Leonard, but many people have contributed to
it one way or another...

If you think you should be included here then write and tell me ;-)

First, a few people/projects whose work I've used:

	Andrew Clover		most of the good file icons
	David MacKenzie		the code for parsing Permissions commands
	John Lindal		co-author of the XDS protocol

And now, people who've actually sent in code ;-)

	Bernard Jungen		lots of patches all over the place!
	Simon Truss		support for mount points on NetBSD

Also - to everyone who sent in bug reports, suggestions and encouragement -
I can't list all of you, but thanks!
