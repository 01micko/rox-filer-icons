			ROX-Filer
			A RISCOS-like filer for X
			by Thomas Leonard

			Introduction

Brief
~~~~~
ROX-Filer is a simple and easy to use graphical file manager for X11, the
windowing system used on Unix and Unix-like operating systems. It is also
the core component of the ROX Desktop.

It supports:

- XDND
	A common drag-and-drop protocol used, for example,
	by the GNOME desktop. This allows data to be loaded
	into an application by dragging it from a filer window
	to a program.

- XDS
	An extension to XDND that allows applications to save
	data by dragging an icon back to a filer window.

- Application directories
	Self contained relocatable applications, where
	installation is as simple as copying it to where you
	want it and uninstalling it is just a matter of
	deleting a directory. Described later in this
	documentation.
