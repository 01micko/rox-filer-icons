			ROX-Filer
			A RISCOS-like filer for X

			Compiling

To find out if you need to compile the filer, first try running it. From a
directory containing the ROX-Filer sub-directory:

	$ ./ROX-Filer/AppRun
	I cannot find an executable file for your host type (Linux-i386).
	Look inside this application directory for a 'src' directory - if
	there is one then try running make inside it to create the executable.

If the above is displayed then you need to recompile. Firstly, ensure
that you have GTK+ installed (version 1.2.0 or later):

	$ gtk-config --version
	1.2.3

If you get an error instead, or you have and out-of-date version, go to
the GTK+ web page and get the latest copy:
	<http://www.gtk.org>

To compile the application:

	$ ./ROX-Filer/AppRun --compile

If that fails, email me and I'll try to fix it. Note, you may have to edit the
Makefile (ROX-Filer/src/Makefile) and change 'gcc' to 'cc' and remove '-Wall -g'
if you can't use gcc.

Otherwise, test it as before:

	$ ./ROX-Filer/AppRun

Hopefully it will work this time!
