			ROX-Filer
			A RISCOS-like filer for X
			by Thomas Leonard

			Running

To start ROX-Filer from the command line you must run the shell script
'AppRun', which is inside the ROX-Filer directory:

	$ ./ROX-Filer/AppRun

By default, ROX-Filer will start by displaying your home directory. You can
get it to display other directories by listing them after the command:

	$ ./ROX-Filer/AppRun /home /usr /usr/local

If you want one of the directories to be opened as a panel put -t, -b, -l or
-r before the directory (for top, bottom, left or right panels).
If you don't know what a panel is, try it and see!
To run the filer in the background, put an & at the end of the line:

	$ mkdir ~/Panel
	$ ln -s $HOME ~/Panel/Home
	$ ./ROX-Filer/AppRun -b ~/Panel &

The panel should be displayed in a window without a title bar. If this does not
work then you may need to update your window manager. The filer was designed
and tested using the Enlightenment window manager:
