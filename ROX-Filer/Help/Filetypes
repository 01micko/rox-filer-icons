			ROX-Filer
			A RISCOS-like filer for X

			File types (technical)

When the filer sees a file it chooses a MIME type for it. This type determines
what icon is used to represent the file and what happens when you open it. Only
regular, non-executable files have MIME types.

To work out what type to give a file the Filer looks up its extension in a
table, which it reads on start up from MIME-types/guess in your Choices
directory. This file is in the same format as the gnome.mime file, although not
all the information in this file is used at present.

To decide what happens when you open the file, the Filer:

- Replaces the / in the MIME type with _.
- Looks for an item with this name in MIME-types in your choices directory.
  If this is not found then it tries again with just the media type.
- Runs the application it files there, passing the pathname of the file as
  the only argument.

So, double clicking on a file of type text/plain may try to run:
  ~/Choices/MIME-types/text_plain/AppRun pathname
If that's not found then it will try:
  ~/Choices/MIME-types/text/AppRun pathname
The idea is that you create symlinks in MIME-types to applications that you
want to handle files of that type.

To decide what icon to give a file the Filer uses the same system, but tries
to find the file in 'MIME-icons' and with '.xpm' on the end.

For example: when trying to display something of type 'image/gif' the following
files may be tried:

Choices/MIME-icons/image_gif.xpm
Choices/MIME-icons/image.xpm
<built-in default icon>
