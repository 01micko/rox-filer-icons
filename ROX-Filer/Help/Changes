			ROX-Filer
			A RISC OS-like filer for X

16-Aug-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Many improvements to the panel - drag and drop to icons, adding new icons,
selections (doesn't grab the primary selection yet though), removing icons
and automatically saving the panel when it's changed.
	
11-Aug-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Improved reference counting on images (hopefully!). Lots of work on
rewriting the panel system.

07-Aug-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Made the timeout for the spring-open feature configurable (requested by
Chris Garrett).

Use short form of --version in install.sh and don't use unsetenv() if it
isn't available (Mattias Engdegård).

06-Aug-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
New options to set the pinboard text foreground and background colours
(suggested by James Kermode).

05-Aug-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Your home directory is now displayed as '~' in the title bar, rather
than as a full path.

01-Aug-2000 (Release 0.1.26)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added a popup menu of commonly used chmod strings to the Permissions
box. Bracketed text and spaces are now ignored in the commands.
Bug fix: Only menu keys changed since the last load were saved!

31-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Bug fix: Mount points on the pinboard didn't always redraw when the
mounted/unmounted state changed.

30-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Renaming now uses the action windows. This means that you can now
rename something onto another filesystem.

28-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
The menu key bindings are now only saved if they actually changed.

Code tidying: Moved some typedefs to the new `global.h' file and
thus removed the dependencies between header files :-)

26-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Tab and Shift-Tab move to next and previous selected item.

25-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
The new display styles can now be saved as the defaults (bug spotted by
Vladimir Klebanov).

When autoscrolling is used, prevent the last-highlighted directory
from springing open. 'spring open' now defaults to off.

The toolbar Up and Home buttons can act as drop targets (and spring open
too!).

Options to set the pinboard text background style (suggested by James
Kermode).

23-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added an option to control the spring-loading feature. Added tooltips
to some of the options. Improved the rule for deciding whether to open
a new window when you click on the toolbar buttons.

Stopped the spring-open window moving while it's open (prevents a bug
in GTK+ from causing problems). Please use GTK+ 1.2.8 or later now!

Dragging near the edge of a window scrolls. Improved the lasso box drag
to use the same system (so it scrolls without you having to move the
mouse).

22-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added 'spring-loaded' directories. If you drag a file over a directory and
hold it there, the directory will spring open! (suggested by Barney
Clarkson)

21-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
In the path entry minibuffer, an exact match is favoured over any other
match. So, if you enter '.xsession' and press Return you'll get it, not
'.xsession-errors' or whatever!

The filer now clears APP_DIR from the environment so that child processes
don't get it. Fixed a bug which caused problems when using a small version
of the 'missing image' image.

19-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Creating a new directory now makes sure the display is updated.

18-Jul-2000 (Release 0.1.25)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Prevent dragging from a pinboard selection to itself, or onto the desktop
background.

17-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Clicking on the root window works (button-1 clears the selection,
button-3 opens the pinboard menu). The pinboard can own the primary
selection, which means that you can select something and then paste
its name into another program.

Keys bound to menu entries are automatically saved when the filer quits.

16-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Changed the install script so that the CVS directories don't get installed.

The 'rox' script now just calls AppRun directly.
Panels can be created without starting a new copy of the filer.
The pinboard can be changed or removed by using --pinboard a second time.

Files can be given as arguments - they are opened as if they were clicked
on in a filer window (suggested by Alex Holden).  If no arguments are
given then the default is now the current directory (not your home
directory).

If you start the leafname in the path minibuffer with '.' then the Show
Hidden feature is temporarily turned on.

15-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Ctrl-clicking selects and unselects pinboard icons. Menu clicking
selects the icon clicked on while the menu is open. Pinned icons are
now updated when the pointer moves over them, if necessary.

14-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Menu-clicking on a pinboard icon now brings up a menu.
Clicks on the root window are still ignored though; need to support
the GNOME-compliant window manager system for passing root clicks on...

12-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Files can now be dragged to pinboard icons, and they highlight nicely too!
If the --override option is used, the filer will bypass the window manager
and position the icons directly.

11-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Pinboard icons can now be dragged to filer windows or applications, just
like normal icons.

10-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Changed the DnD code to make it easier for the pinboard code to use it.
Up and Home buttons on the toolbar now use the 'New window on button 1'
option setting (suggested by Vincent Lefèvre).

09-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Pinboard can have mount points and symlinks on it.

06-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Dragging with the Menu button moves icons around. Clicking with the
other button removes icons from the pinboard.

05-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Dragging files to the pinboard adds them to it and automatically saves
the pinboard too.

02-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Pinboard is now loaded from a file specified on the command line.

01-Jul-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
'Home' now appears on the background if you run it with --pinboard.
Clicking opens your home directory. Doesn't do much else.
Fixed a bug which prevented the minibuffer label from appearing on
some versions of GTK+.

30-Jun-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
First steps towards pinboard support (requested by P.S.S.Camp and
Darren Winsper).

16-Jun-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Changed the Display menu layout - now there are four basic types (Large or
Small, with or without details) and the type of detail desired is chosen
from a sub-sub-menu.

Added a new display style - bars showing the sizes of the files. The bars are
drawn on a log scale.

15-Jun-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Changed the display menu - you can now choose large or small icons, with or
without details. The details displayed can also be changed. I'm not quite
happy with the UI yet though...

Split the filer.c source file into two (filer.c and display.c) since it was
becoming rather unwieldy. This means that some of the option names have
changed because they've moved to a new section in the options window...

14-Jun-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Fixed a problem where ImLib support failed on multi-depth displays (reported
by Stephen Harrison).

06-Jun-2000 (Release 0.1.24)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added the install.sh script for easier installation.
Removed 'MIME-info' file from ROX-Filer - now we always assume that the
standard types are in Choices.
Fixed a bug which could cause 'top' panels to appear in the wrong place
(Alex Holden).
Changed the sort order for Sort By Type so that directories come before
files (suggested by Chris Garrett).
`Single-click navigation' and 'Ignore case when sorting' now both default
to On.

03-Jun-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Improved the theme support to allow tiled background images.
Fixed a bug which prevented tilde expansion from working in the
shell command minibuffer.

02-Jun-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Made the help button look a bit nicer and changed the Find and Permissions
action windows to use the icon instead of a text button.
Removed the 3D borders from the help and toolbar buttons when not selected
(looks much better!). Setting a run action by dragging to a symlink now
dereferences the link (suggested by Ewan Mac Mahon).

Default search path for Choices is now:
	~/Choices:/usr/local/share/Choices:/usr/share/Choices

Fixed (possibly) a bug which sometimes causes the redraw to miss bits. This
probably slows everything down, but the next Gtk+ release should do double
buffering so all this will get changed then...

01-Jun-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added a Help icon to the toolbar, which does the same as choosing `Show
ROX-Filer Help' from the menu.

25-May-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Started adding some code to truncate long filenames (not finished yet).
Fixed a bug which could cause directories to appear empty when using VFS.
Added the 'Select If' minibuffer, which selects all files matching the
entered expression.

21-May-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Moved most of the icons from pixmaps to MIME-icons (outside ROX-Filer).
Updated several of the remaining icons by copying them from the GNOME
desktop (suggested by Volker Braun).


16-May-2000 (Release 0.1.23)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added the `Window->Set Run Action' menu item. This allows you to specify the
default run action for a file by simply dragging the file into a program.
You can also enter a shell command in the minibuffer to make that command
the default.
The cursor is a bit nicer and usually appears where you want it to now. You
can also get rid of it by pressing Escape.

12-May-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Applied Bernard's patch (a couple of cosmetic changes to the action windows).
Applied Vincent's patch (minor updates to the Frech translation).
Fixed a problem with the pixmap caching - the filer would detect that the
file had changed and try to reload it, but ImLib would simply return its
cached copy!

28-Apr-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Removed a debugging message that had somehow got into the release version :-(
Fixed a bug in the minibuffer code - pressing Return when the cursor was in
an empty directory caused odd effects.

24-Apr-2000 (Release 0.1.22)
~~~~~~~~~~~
When starting, the filer will check to see if it is already running.
If it is then the arguments are passed to that copy.

23-Apr-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Bug fix: Attempting to open a Find preview window could cause a crash
if the directory containing the item could not be opened.
Button-3 clicking on the toolbar icons opens a new window.


21-Apr-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added Vincent Lefevre's French translation. Changed to using my own
gettext function because some platforms don't have it or implement
it differently.

18-Apr-2000 (Release 0.1.21)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Completed marking translatable strings. Dragging with the middle button
now moves files.

17-Apr-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Made lots of changes to the way menus are stored; this makes i18n of the
menus easier.

16-Apr-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added GNU gettext support.
Shell meta-characters in shell commands are escaped.

15-Apr-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Tab in the shell commands minibuffer does shell-style completion.

14-Apr-2000 (Release 0.1.20)
~~~~~~~~~~~
ImLib is used for rendering if possible. Small Icons super-samples the
image down.

13-Apr-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Copying from inside a VFS directory now works.

09-Apr-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added the Shell Command feature to the minibuffer.
Fixed a bug which causes unnecessary flickering when a hidden file was
detected.
Removed 'Touch' from the menu; easy enough from the minibuffer now.
Changed the type guessing system - scans all files in MIME-info directories
now.

02-Apr-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added a nice list displaying the found files. Clicking opens a preview window
onto the directory and winks the file.

18-Mar-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Merged the MIME-Type and Special fields in the info window into a single
Type field (since only one could be used at a time anyway).
Made lots of changes to the panel menu. You can now remove things much more
easily.
Unstat()able files now display the error message in the Full Info display,
instead of random values.
Check for copying a directory onto itself, as well as into itself.

Applied Bernard's patch:
- Copy (menu entry) now works with action window.
- Deleted/moved directory displays are automatically hidden.
- Added option not to allow run/copy when object
  dragged to filer (not panels) icons. Some people like
  it the RISC OS way...
- Full info alignment of App objects and owner/group
  alignment corrected.
- Info window: added special info for symlinks, apps
  and mount points.

17-Mar-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added support for mc's Virtual File System.

12-Mar-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
New Window appears greyed out if Unique Windows is selected.
Added 'Permissions' (chmod) feature.

10-Mar-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added Bernard Jungen's patch:
- Dates are displayed in a more RISC OS like format.
- (Scanning) is shown in the titlebar during scans.
- Option to only display one window per directory.
- User and group names displayed in the Full Info view.
- Open Parent in the root does nothing.
- Errors in options are only reported once.
- File does chdir() if -b isn't possible (prevents getting the full path
  in the file(1) says... box).
