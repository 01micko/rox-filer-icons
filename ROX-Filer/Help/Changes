			by Thomas Leonard

~~~~~~~~~~~
Completed marking translatable strings. Dragging with the middle button
now moves files.

17-Apr-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Made lots of changes to the way menus are stored; this makes i18n of the
menus easier.

16-Apr-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added GNU gettext support.
Shell meta-characters in shell commands are escaped.

15-Apr-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Tab in the shell commands minibuffer does shell-style completion.

14-Apr-2000 (Release 0.1.20)
~~~~~~~~~~~
ImLib is used for rendering if possible. Small Icons super-samples the
image down.

13-Apr-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Copying from inside a VFS directory now works.

09-Apr-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added the Shell Command feature to the minibuffer.
Fixed a bug which causes unnecessary flickering when a hidden file was
detected.
Removed 'Touch' from the menu; easy enough from the minibuffer now.
Changed the type guessing system - scans all files in MIME-info directories
now.

02-Apr-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added a nice list displaying the found files. Clicking opens a preview window
onto the directory and winks the file.

18-Mar-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Merged the MIME-Type and Special fields in the info window into a single
Type field (since only one could be used at a time anyway).
Made lots of changes to the panel menu. You can now remove things much more
easily.
Unstat()able files now display the error message in the Full Info display,
instead of random values.
Check for copying a directory onto itself, as well as into itself.

Applied Bernard's patch:
- Copy (menu entry) now works with action window.
- Deleted/moved directory displays are automatically hidden.
- Added option not to allow run/copy when object
  dragged to filer (not panels) icons. Some people like
  it the RISC OS way...
- Full info alignment of App objects and owner/group
  alignment corrected.
- Info window: added special info for symlinks, apps
  and mount points.

17-Mar-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added support for mc's Virtual File System.

12-Mar-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
New Window appears greyed out if Unique Windows is selected.
Added 'Permissions' (chmod) feature.

10-Mar-20000
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Added Bernard Jungen's patch:
- Dates are displayed in a more RISC OS like format.
- (Scanning) is shown in the titlebar during scans.
- Option to only display one window per directory.
- User and group names displayed in the Full Info view.
- Open Parent in the root does nothing.
- Errors in options are only reported once.
- File does chdir() if -b isn't possible (prevents getting the full path
  in the file(1) says... box).
