			ROX-Filer
			A RISCOS-like filer for X
			by Thomas Leonard

This is a list of features that should/will be added when I have time (or when
someone sends patches!).


BUGS

Rename box - use action window (currently doesn't work across file systems)

GNOME toolbar doesn't work properly when detached. Is this a GTK+ problem?


MISSING FEATURES

Back/Forwards browser style navigation?

Textured window backgrounds (themes?)

Long leafnames get truncated / wrap onto multiple lines.

Remote control an already-running filer (CORBA?)

More permissions checking in Find?

Fully configurable toolbar.

Adjust-drag to move (without having to hold down Shift).


RISC OS COMPATIBILITY

The menu opens with `File 'file'' under the pointer. Under RO it was the
Display menu.


OTHERS

Holding a file being saved over a directory should open the directory (Mac
style)? Make it optional?

Copying a relative symlink should make it absolute? Ask during the copy?

Recursive 'a-x' acts on the directory first and so can't then change the
permissions on the contents. chmod(1) has the same problem.
