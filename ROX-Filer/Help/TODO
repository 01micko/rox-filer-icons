			ROX-Filer
			A RISCOS-like filer for X
			by Thomas Leonard

This is a list of features that should/will be added when I have time (or
when someone sends patches!).


BUGS

The Message Log window sometimes just stops responding to events (such
as delete-window). The widgets inside still work, though...

Autosizing problems:
- Mount points always come out too small...

Panels sometimes appear in the wrong place (WM issue?).

In Full Info, clicking beyond the far right column acts like clicking
on the right-most item.

FEATURES FOR 1.1

Lasso box with the middle button should toggle their selected state.

On Shift-Menu-click, send the filename to a script and parse the results
as a menu of commands to execute.

User-definable icons for the different mount points.

Highlight Find expressions in red while they're invalid. Also, do this
in the minibuffer.

Long leafnames wrap onto multiple lines.

Fully configurable toolbar.

Use an environment variable to override the platform-name guessing in
AppRun.

Improve MIME-type guessing:
	- Use regexp rules on whole name (eg for 'Makefile' and 'core')

Provide a way to set the display style on a per-directory basis
(shell glob patterns?)

Right-most icon in the last row should extend to the far right of the window,
even if it isn't in the last column.

Thumbnails display style which loads images and displays them in the filer
window.


OTHERS

Have a 'Templates' directory in Choices. Make 'New Directory' a submenu
which list these files or directories?

Close Panel menu item?

Toolbar buttons for sort type?

Highlighting of icons as you drag a box around them, so it's clear what you
have caught in the box.

Control setup of pinboard and panels from the GUI?

Allow applets inside the panel? Allow the filer to go inside GNOME-panel
and similar?

Back/Forwards browser style navigation?

More permissions checking in Find?

Enable (temporarily) single-click navigation when a special key (e.g. Alt)
is pressed?

In single click mode, beep when the user tries to double click?

Options to set where the toolbar appears.

Display extra info in the toolbar (file under cursor, size, etc).

Tooltips to show extra detail about items.

Features to automatically set the size of filer windows? Or a button
to force a resize?

Copying a relative symlink should make it absolute? Ask during the copy?

Recursive 'a-x' acts on the directory first and so can't then change the
permissions on the contents. chmod(1) has the same problem.


LONG TERM

Use a separate process to access the filesystem. Prevents hanging when you
try to access a dead filesystem.

Allow user to change permissions to another user on the fly, by entering a
password. 'su' requires a tty - do we need an SUID binary?
