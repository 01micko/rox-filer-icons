			ROX-Filer
			A RISCOS-like filer for X
			by Thomas Leonard

This is a list of features that should/will be added when I have time (or when
someone sends patches!).


BUGS

Copy/Rename/Link - use exec() instead of system() like the action windows do.
		(prevents problems with shell special characters).

GNOME toolbar doesn't work properly when detached. Is this a GTK+ problem?

Cursor should be displayed shaded when the collection widget doesn't have
the focus.


MISSING FEATURES

Permissions/Touch/Find

Open new windows with the same options as their parent and/or default values
in the Options dialog.

Drag and drop in the Copy/Rename/Link dialogs.

Drop apps onto the iconbar to add them automatically.

Allow data to be saved from an application via XDS directly into a panel
application (and maybe apps in normal filer windows too).

Disallow copying a directory into itself?

Some visual indication that a directory is being rescanned?

Back/Forwards browser style navigation?

Textured window backgrounds (themes?)


RISC OS COMPATIBILITY

The menu opens with `File 'file'' under the pointer. Under RO it was the
Display menu.


OTHERS

Holding a file being saved over a directory should open the directory (Mac
style)? Make it optional?

Copying a relative symlink should make it absolute? Ask during the copy?
