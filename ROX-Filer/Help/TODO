			ROX-Filer
			A RISCOS-like filer for X
			by Thomas Leonard

This is a list of features that should/will be added when I have time (or
when someone sends patches!).

BUGS

Pinboard icons can only be dragged one at a time.

Remove icon should work with MIME stuff.

Think about XXXs in dnd menu.

Deleting a symlink to a pinboard icon shows a warning

Gtk+ 2.0:
	- Panel menu appears, but menu item under cursor doesn't highlight
		(GTK bug?)
	- Pinboard text background types none/outline don't work
	- Can't set menu shortcuts to a single key (eg, 'L') (GTK bug)
	- Eventboxes don't DnD highlight (GTK bug)
	- Details should use a monospace font (GTK bug?)
	- Action window log doesn't scroll properly (GTK bugs?)

'Edit Item' doesn't make much sense for applets...

Rescanning sometimes causes the display to scroll (automounter problem).

Panel sometimes won't accept drops (window frame problem?).

Deleting / moving files should update the globicons.


FEATURES FOR 1.1

Option to mount on click, Shift+Click to open without mounting.

When following symlinks, don't convert to the 'real' path. Up should
go back to the directory containing the symlink.

Save groups (Ctrl+[0-9]).

Make Find expressions easier for beginners.

Improve thumbnail handling:
	- Lazy scanning?
	- Recursive scanning?

Individual sliders for max window horizontal and vertical sizes.

Winking of items should be an option.

Scanning:
	- Use dir_check_this in more places
	- Clear window before resizing

Don't beep for paths with a # in the leafname (for AVFS).

Path Entry minibuffer -- add a drop down list for bookmarks.
Way to reopen last closed directory. Also do this for Select If.

Set a property giving the panel side (for applet menus).

Shift-click on symlink should open the file. Add a 'Follow link' submenu.

Option to make menu-click over a file open the File submenu only?

Key bindings in the New File menu doesn't work (move to dialog box?).

All leafnames to be truncated, even when details are displayed.

Use an environment variable to override the platform-name guessing in
AppRun.

Provide a way to set the display style on a per-directory basis
(shell glob patterns?) Also remember window size?

Right-most icon in the last row should extend to the far right of the window,
even if it isn't in the last column.

Allow find expression with Permissions command...

Use AA fonts for details with Gtk+-2.0.


OTHERS

Fully configurable toolbar?

Corner panels?

Close Panel menu item?

Toolbar buttons for sort type?

Highlighting of icons as you drag a box around them, so it's clear what you
have caught in the box?

Allow the filer to go inside GNOME-panel and similar?

More permissions checking in Find? -RWX?

Enable (temporarily) single-click navigation when a special key (e.g. Alt)
is pressed?

In single click mode, beep when the user tries to double click?

Options to set where the toolbar appears?

Copying a relative symlink should make it absolute? Ask during the copy?

Recursive 'a-x' acts on the directory first and so can't then change the
permissions on the contents. chmod(1) has the same problem.

Option to disable open-file-and-close-window behaviour (sometimes happens
accidentally)?

Items on the panel should be sensitive right up to the edge of the screen
(GTK bug prevents this currently - should be fixed by 1.2.11).

Remember last scroll position when returning to a directory?


LONG TERM

Use a separate process to access the filesystem. Prevents hanging when you
try to access a dead filesystem.

Allow user to change permissions to another user on the fly, by entering a
password. 'su' requires a tty - do we need an SUID binary?
