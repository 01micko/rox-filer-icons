			ROX-Filer
			A RISCOS-like filer for X
			by Thomas Leonard

This is a list of features that should/will be added when I have time (or when
someone sends patches!).


BUGS

Rename box - use action window (currently doesn't work across file systems)

GNOME toolbar
	- doesn't work properly when detached. Is this a GTK+ problem?
	- 'Other Action' doesn't work

Set Run Action: deref symlinks

Moving a directory (outside of the filer) causes an error when you try
to access it (OK), but the error is still reported when you open the
directory in its new location until you click refresh.


MISSING FEATURES

Allow applets inside the panel? Allow the filer to go inside GNOME-panel
and similar?

Scrollable panel (already works with wheel-mice).

Back/Forwards browser style navigation?

Better installation (eg, install in /usr/local/*; but keep the app dir
structure).

Textured window backgrounds (themes?)

Long leafnames get truncated / wrap onto multiple lines.

Better icon arrangement (different column widths?)

More permissions checking in Find?

Fully configurable toolbar. Allow clicking button 2 on buttons.

Can't create a panel if the filer is already running.

Use an environment variable to override the platform-name guessing in AppRun.

People sometimes forget to save the key bindings - remind them somehow?

Enable (temporarily) single-click navigation when a special key (e.g. Alt) is
pressed?

'Other Action' should work on either 'other' button.

Improve MIME-type guessing:
	- Try to find longest extension match (eg .ps.gz, then .gz)
	- Try again ignoring case (so .BMP matches .bmp) (.C must still work!)
	- Use regexp rules on whole name (eg for 'Makefile' and 'core')

Provide a way to set the display style on a per-directory basis
(shell glob patterns?)


RISC OS COMPATIBILITY

The menu opens with `File 'file'' under the pointer. Under RO it was the
Display menu.


OTHERS

Holding a file being saved over a directory should open the directory (Mac
style)? Make it optional?

Copying a relative symlink should make it absolute? Ask during the copy?

Recursive 'a-x' acts on the directory first and so can't then change the
permissions on the contents. chmod(1) has the same problem.

Set Run Action should be on the 'File' menu, not in the minibuffer.
