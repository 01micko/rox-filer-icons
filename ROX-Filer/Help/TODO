			ROX-Filer
			A RISCOS-like filer for X
			by Thomas Leonard

This is a list of features that should/will be added when I have time (or when
someone sends patches!).


BUGS

Rename box - use action window (currently doesn't work across file systems)

GNOME toolbar
	- doesn't work properly when detached. Is this a GTK+ problem?
	- 'Other Action' doesn't work


MISSING FEATURES

Back/Forwards browser style navigation?

Textured window backgrounds (themes?)

Long leafnames get truncated / wrap onto multiple lines.

More permissions checking in Find?

Fully configurable toolbar.

Can't create a panel if the filer is already running.

Use an environment variable to override the platform-name guessing in AppRun.

People sometimes forget to save the key bindings - remind them somehow?

Enable (temporarily) single-click navigation when a special key (e.g. Alt) is
pressed?

'Other Action' should work on either 'other' button.

Improve MIME-type guessing:
	- Try to find longest extension match (eg .ps.gz, then .gz)
	- Try again ignoring case (so .BMP matches .bmp) (.C must still work!)
	- Use regexp rules on whole name (eg for 'Makefile' and 'core')

Make the run-actions easier to set up (ie, from a dialog box).

Provide a way to set the display style on a per-directory basis
(shell glob patterns?)


RISC OS COMPATIBILITY

The menu opens with `File 'file'' under the pointer. Under RO it was the
Display menu.


OTHERS

Holding a file being saved over a directory should open the directory (Mac
style)? Make it optional?

Copying a relative symlink should make it absolute? Ask during the copy?

Recursive 'a-x' acts on the directory first and so can't then change the
permissions on the contents. chmod(1) has the same problem.
