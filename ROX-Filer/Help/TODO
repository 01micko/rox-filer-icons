			ROX-Filer
			A RISCOS-like filer for X
			by Thomas Leonard

This is a list of features that should/will be added when I have time (or
when someone sends patches!).

Note: Currently in the middle of upgrading the dir scanning code.
	Check it carefully!! Ignore debugging output.
	
	- Only resize according to options & not on every rescan
	- Optimise dir_check_this
	- Think about needs_rescan, etc
	- Remove debugging output
	- Clear window before resizing

BUGS

Gtk+ 2.0:
	- Deleting a symlink to a pinboard icon shows a warning
	- Clicking on the scrollbar when you can't scroll blanks the window!
	- Menu appears, but item under cursor isn't opened
	- Savebox doesn't highlight leafname
	- Pinboard text background types none/outline don't work
	- Can't set menu shortcuts to a single key (eg, 'L')

Return for 'Do another search' toggles Quiet...

'Edit Item' doesn't make much sense for applets...

Root click with sawfish 0.99 doesn't work.


FEATURES FOR 1.1

Way to reopen last closed directory.

Shift-click on symlink should open the file. Add a 'Follow link' submenu.

Convert manual to HTML (smaller -- manual may get translated).

Option to make menu-click over a file open the File submenu only?

Key bindings in the New File menu don't work.

Send To menu to show the contents of '<Choices>/Send To'.

All leafnames to be truncated, even when details are displayed.

Use an environment variable to override the platform-name guessing in
AppRun.

Improve MIME-type guessing:
	- Use regexp rules on whole name (eg for 'Makefile' and 'core')

Provide a way to set the display style on a per-directory basis
(shell glob patterns?)

Right-most icon in the last row should extend to the far right of the window,
even if it isn't in the last column.

Allow find expression with Permissions command...


OTHERS

Fully configurable toolbar?

Corner panels?

Tooltips to show extra detail about items?

Close Panel menu item?

Toolbar buttons for sort type?

Highlighting of icons as you drag a box around them, so it's clear what you
have caught in the box?

Allow the filer to go inside GNOME-panel and similar?

More permissions checking in Find?

Enable (temporarily) single-click navigation when a special key (e.g. Alt)
is pressed?

In single click mode, beep when the user tries to double click?

Options to set where the toolbar appears?

Copying a relative symlink should make it absolute? Ask during the copy?

Recursive 'a-x' acts on the directory first and so can't then change the
permissions on the contents. chmod(1) has the same problem.

Option to disable open-file-and-close-window behaviour (sometimes happens
accidentally)?

Options for 'Force' and 'Brief'?

Items on the panel should be sensitive right up to the edge of the screen
(GTK bug prevents this currently - should be fixed by 1.2.11).

On Shift-Menu-click, send the filename to a script and parse the results
as a menu of commands to execute?

Remember last scroll position when returning to a directory?


LONG TERM

Use a separate process to access the filesystem. Prevents hanging when you
try to access a dead filesystem.

Allow user to change permissions to another user on the fly, by entering a
password. 'su' requires a tty - do we need an SUID binary?
