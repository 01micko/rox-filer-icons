			ROX-Filer
			A RISCOS-like filer for X
			by Thomas Leonard

This is a list of features that should/will be added when I have time (or when
someone sends patches!).


BUGS

Moving a directory (outside of the filer) causes an error when you try
to access it (OK), but the error is still reported when you open the
directory in its new location until you click refresh.


MISSING FEATURES

Make the panel work more like the pinboard.

User-definable icons for the different mount points.

Highlighting of icons as you drag a box around them, so its clear what you
have caught in the box.

Control setup of pinboard and panels from the GUI?

Allow applets inside the panel? Allow the filer to go inside GNOME-panel
and similar?

Highlight Find expressions in red while they're invalid. Also, do this
in the minibuffer.

Scrollable panel (already works with wheel-mice).

Back/Forwards browser style navigation?

Long leafnames wrap onto multiple lines.

Better icon arrangement (different column widths?)

More permissions checking in Find?

Fully configurable toolbar.

Use an environment variable to override the platform-name guessing in
AppRun.

Enable (temporarily) single-click navigation when a special key (e.g. Alt)
is pressed?

Improve MIME-type guessing:
	- Try to find longest extension match (eg .ps.gz, then .gz)
	- Try again ignoring case (so .BMP matches .bmp) (.C must still work!)
	- Use regexp rules on whole name (eg for 'Makefile' and 'core')

Provide a way to set the display style on a per-directory basis
(shell glob patterns?)

In single click mode, beep when the user tries to double click.

Options to set where the toolbar appears.

Display extra info in the toolbar (file under cursor, size, target mode, etc).

More display styles.

Features to (automatically?) set the size of filer windows.


RISC OS COMPATIBILITY

The menu opens with `File 'file'' under the pointer. Under RO it was the
Display menu.


OTHERS

Copying a relative symlink should make it absolute? Ask during the copy?

Recursive 'a-x' acts on the directory first and so can't then change the
permissions on the contents. chmod(1) has the same problem.

Set Run Action should be on the 'File' menu, not in the minibuffer.
