			ROX-Filer
			A RISCOS-like filer for X
			by Thomas Leonard

This is a list of features that should/will be added when I have time (or
when someone sends patches!).


BUGS

Setting an icon (eg, for 'text/plain') should refresh the views.

Dragging a pinboard icon doesn't remove the tooltip.

When the minibuffer is highlighted in red, scanning more items should recheck.

Using spring-opening with a missing directory has grab problems (Gkt+
problem?).

Dirs in /proc which have no access permission keep bringing up error boxes.

Dragging a pinboard icon to move it should be sensitive even while the pointer
is still over the icon.

Escape text/uri-list.


FEATURES FOR 1.3

Auto-unmount when last directory is closed?

Iconfied windows should have a button-type style (Joakim Andreasson).

Active icons in iconified windows (Christian V. J. Brüssow).

Allow changing the pinboard style without having to drag the image back in
(Jesse Wagner).

Use dnotify on Linux to find out when directories change.

Put groups on Select menu.

Use XFS extended attribute to store MIME types.

Clean out thumbnails cache (memory and disk) from time to time.

More options to set fonts?

Option to show DnD menu on button-1 drags (for pen users).

Put Disk Usage in the Info box.

Tab completion in save boxes.

Have an option to set what happens when you double-click the background.

User icons for mounted/unmounted?

Order icons vertically or horizontally (option).

Rescanning sometimes causes the display to scroll (automounter problem).

Allow command-line arguments for executation pinboard/panel icons.

Opening an AVFS directory with left-click should reuse the same window.

Deleting / moving files should update the globicons?

Remove icon should work with MIME stuff.

'Edit Item' doesn't make much sense for applets...

Option to mount on click, Shift+Click to open without mounting.

Make Find expressions easier for beginners.

Individual sliders for max window horizontal and vertical sizes.

Winking of items should be an option.

Path Entry minibuffer -- add a drop down list for bookmarks.
Way to reopen last closed directory. Also do this for Select If.

Shift-click on symlink should open the file. Add a 'Follow link' submenu.

Option to make menu-click over a file open the File submenu only?

Key bindings in the New File menu doesn't work (move to dialog box?).

All leafnames to be truncated, even when details are displayed.
Use condensed fonts for long names?

Use an environment variable to override the platform-name guessing in
AppRun.

Provide a way to set the display style on a per-directory basis
(shell glob patterns?) Also remember window size?

Right-most icon in the last row should extend to the far right of the window,
even if it isn't in the last column.

Allow filtering on any expression (not just Show Hidden).

Allow find expression with Permissions command...


OTHERS

Fully configurable toolbar?

Corner panels?

Close Panel menu item?

Toolbar buttons for sort type?

Highlighting of icons as you drag a box around them, so it's clear what you
have caught in the box?

More permissions checking in Find? -RWX?

Enable (temporarily) single-click navigation when a special key is pressed?

In single click mode, beep when the user tries to double click?

Copying a relative symlink should make it absolute? Ask during the copy?

Recursive 'a-x' acts on the directory first and so can't then change the
permissions on the contents. chmod(1) has the same problem.

Option to disable open-file-and-close-window behaviour (sometimes happens
accidentally)?

Remember last scroll position when returning to a directory?

'Edge folders' (panel items spring-open with zero delay when the pointer
is at the edge of the scree)?

SOAP calls to remove pinboard/panel icons?


LONG TERM

Use a separate process to access the filesystem. Prevents hanging when you
try to access a dead filesystem. Do this via gnome-vfs?

Allow user to change permissions to another user on the fly, by entering a
password. 'su' requires a tty - use xsu?
