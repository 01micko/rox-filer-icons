			ROX-Filer
			A RISCOS-like filer for X
			by Thomas Leonard

This is a list of features that should/will be added when I have time (or
when someone sends patches!).


FEATURES FOR 1.3

Put Disk Usage in the Info box.

Thumbnailing in a sub-process.

Tab completion in save boxes.

Have an option to set what happens when you double-click the background.

Option to auto-choose Large or Small icons depending on the number of files.

Using spring-opening with a missing directory has grab problems (Gkt+
problem?).

Pinboard text background types none/outline don't work

User icons for mounted/unmounted?

When setting the icon for a directory, offer to create a .DirIcon instead of
adding a path to globicons.

Order icons vertically or horizontally (option).

Rescanning sometimes causes the display to scroll (automounter problem).

Panel sometimes won't accept drops (sawfish bug).

Allow command-line arguments for executation pinboard/panel icons.

Opening an AVFS directory with left-click should reuse the same window.

Allow subdirectories inside SendTo, shown as submenus.

Deleting / moving files should update the globicons?

Pinboard icons can only be dragged one at a time.

Remove icon should work with MIME stuff.

'Edit Item' doesn't make much sense for applets...

Option to mount on click, Shift+Click to open without mounting.

When following symlinks, don't convert to the 'real' path. Up should
go back to the directory containing the symlink.

Make Find expressions easier for beginners.

Improve thumbnail handling:
	- Lazy scanning?
	- Recursive scanning?
	- Create in subprocess

Individual sliders for max window horizontal and vertical sizes.

Winking of items should be an option.

Don't beep for paths with a # in the leafname (for AVFS).

Path Entry minibuffer -- add a drop down list for bookmarks.
Way to reopen last closed directory. Also do this for Select If.

Shift-click on symlink should open the file. Add a 'Follow link' submenu.

Option to make menu-click over a file open the File submenu only?

Key bindings in the New File menu doesn't work (move to dialog box?).

Option to set fonts.

All leafnames to be truncated, even when details are displayed.
Use condensed fonts for long names?

Use an environment variable to override the platform-name guessing in
AppRun.

Provide a way to set the display style on a per-directory basis
(shell glob patterns?) Also remember window size?

Right-most icon in the last row should extend to the far right of the window,
even if it isn't in the last column.

Allow find expression with Permissions command...

Use same MIME-info database as GNOME. Still use our own system for MIME
handlers, though.


OTHERS

Fully configurable toolbar?

Corner panels?

Close Panel menu item?

Toolbar buttons for sort type?

Highlighting of icons as you drag a box around them, so it's clear what you
have caught in the box?

Allow the filer to go inside GNOME-panel and similar?

More permissions checking in Find? -RWX?

Enable (temporarily) single-click navigation when a special key (e.g. Alt)
is pressed?

In single click mode, beep when the user tries to double click?

Options to set where the toolbar appears?

Copying a relative symlink should make it absolute? Ask during the copy?

Recursive 'a-x' acts on the directory first and so can't then change the
permissions on the contents. chmod(1) has the same problem.

Option to disable open-file-and-close-window behaviour (sometimes happens
accidentally)?

Remember last scroll position when returning to a directory?

'Edge folders'?


LONG TERM

Use a separate process to access the filesystem. Prevents hanging when you
try to access a dead filesystem. Do this via gnome-vfs?

Allow user to change permissions to another user on the fly, by entering a
password. 'su' requires a tty - use xsu?
