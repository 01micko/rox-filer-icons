			ROX-Filer
			A RISCOS-like filer for X
			by Thomas Leonard

This is a list of features that should/will be added when I have time (or
when someone sends patches!).


			BUGS


dnotify: should wait a little before rescanning.

GtkTreeView bindings (eg, ^N) override menu bindings.

Autoscrolling during DnD has stopped working.

File2.html comes before File.html. Also, very large numbers aren't handled.

Can't drag to a selected item (from another window).

Adding a directory to the panel and then changing it to an application doesn't
hide the text.

Fix ~/.thumbnails trying to thumbnail thumbnails!

Setting an icon (eg, for 'text/plain') should refresh the views.

Dragging a pinboard icon doesn't remove the tooltip.

When the minibuffer is highlighted in red, scanning more items should recheck.

Using spring-opening with a missing directory has grab problems (Gkt+
problem?).

Dirs in /proc which have no access permission keep bringing up error boxes.

Dragging a pinboard icon to move it should be sensitive even while the pointer
is still over the icon.

Escape text/uri-list.

Keep the title up-to-date for iconified windows.

Symlinks to mount points work strangely (Daniele Peri).


			FEATURES FOR 1.3

Bookmarks:
- Drag to Edit window or toolbar icon. Spring loading (Stephen Watson)?
- Short name for bookmarks.

Set size of panel icons.

Stretch / scale pinboard options.

Option to show DnD menu on button-1 drags (for pen users).

			FEATURES FOR 2.1

Bookmarks:
- Show selection groups?
- Auto-add recent operations

Some way to process the files found by Find.

Dragging over the panel should do the raise thing.

Auto-unmount when last directory is closed.

Active icons in iconified windows (Christian V. J. Brüssow).

When all selected items have the same type, show handlers for that type on
the SendTo menu (Arnaud Calvo)?

Allow changing the pinboard style without having to drag the image back in
(Jesse Wagner).

Use XFS extended attribute to store MIME types.

More options to set fonts?

Put Disk Usage in the Info box?

Tab completion in save boxes.

Have an option to set what happens when you double-click the background.
Or disable this... the toolbar can be used to resize.

Order icons vertically or horizontally (option).

Rescanning sometimes causes the display to scroll (automounter problem).

Allow command-line arguments for executation pinboard/panel icons.

Opening an AVFS directory with left-click should reuse the same window.

Deleting / moving files should update the globicons?

Remove icon should work with MIME stuff.

'Edit Item' doesn't make much sense for applets...

Make Find expressions easier for beginners.

Individual sliders for max window horizontal and vertical sizes.

Winking of items should be an option.

Shell / Select If history menu.

Shift-click on symlink should open the file. Add a 'Follow link' submenu.

Option to make menu-click over a file open the File submenu only?

Key bindings in the New File menu don't work (move to dialog box?).

All leafnames to be truncated, even when details are displayed.
Use condensed fonts for long names?

Use an environment variable to override the platform-name guessing in
AppRun.

Provide a way to set the display style on a per-directory basis
(shell glob patterns?) Also remember window size?

Right-most icon in the last row should extend to the far right of the window,
even if it isn't in the last column.

Allow filtering on any expression (not just Show Hidden).

Allow find expression with Permissions command...


			OTHERS


Fully configurable toolbar?

Corner panels?

Close Panel menu item?

Highlighting of icons as you drag a box around them, so it's clear what you
have caught in the box?

More permissions checking in Find? -RWX?

Enable (temporarily) single-click navigation when a special key is pressed?

In single click mode, beep when the user tries to double click?

Copying a relative symlink should make it absolute? Ask during the copy?

Recursive 'a-x' acts on the directory first and so can't then change the
permissions on the contents. chmod(1) has the same problem.

Option to disable open-file-and-close-window behaviour (sometimes happens
accidentally)?

Remember last scroll position when returning to a directory?

'Edge folders' (panel items spring-open with zero delay when the pointer
is at the edge of the scree)?

SOAP calls to remove pinboard/panel icons?

AppInfo.xml (Christopher Arndt):
	<Property name="x-on-drop-move" value="--move"/>
	<Property name="x-on-drop-link" value="--link"/>



			LONG TERM


Use a separate process to access the filesystem. Prevents hanging when you
try to access a dead filesystem. Do this via gnome-vfs?

Allow user to change permissions to another user on the fly, by entering a
password. 'su' requires a tty - use xsu?
