			ROX-Filer
			A RISCOS-like filer for X
			by Thomas Leonard

This is a list of features that should/will be added when I have time (or
when someone sends patches!).


BUGS

Ctrl-click-drag doesn't work as well as button-2-click drag.


FEATURES FOR 1.0

Allow renaming of panel and pinboard icons. Also allow '~' (for
system-wide configuration).

Size limit on AppIcon files.


FEATURES FOR 1.1

Toolbar buttons for sort type?

User-definable icons for the different mount points.

Highlighting of icons as you drag a box around them, so its clear what you
have caught in the box.

Control setup of pinboard and panels from the GUI?

Allow applets inside the panel? Allow the filer to go inside GNOME-panel
and similar?

Highlight Find expressions in red while they're invalid. Also, do this
in the minibuffer.

Back/Forwards browser style navigation?

Long leafnames wrap onto multiple lines.

Better icon arrangement (different column widths?)

More permissions checking in Find?

Fully configurable toolbar.

Use an environment variable to override the platform-name guessing in
AppRun.

Enable (temporarily) single-click navigation when a special key (e.g. Alt)
is pressed?

Improve MIME-type guessing:
	- Try to find longest extension match (eg .ps.gz, then .gz)
	- Try again ignoring case (so .BMP matches .bmp) (.C must still work!)
	- Use regexp rules on whole name (eg for 'Makefile' and 'core')

Provide a way to set the display style on a per-directory basis
(shell glob patterns?)

In single click mode, beep when the user tries to double click?

Options to set where the toolbar appears.

Display extra info in the toolbar (file under cursor, size, etc).

More display styles.

Features to automatically set the size of filer windows?


RISC OS COMPATIBILITY

The menu opens with `File 'file'' under the pointer. Under RO it was the
Display menu.


OTHERS

Copying a relative symlink should make it absolute? Ask during the copy?

Recursive 'a-x' acts on the directory first and so can't then change the
permissions on the contents. chmod(1) has the same problem.


LONG TERM

Use a separate process to access the filesystem. Prevents hanging when you
try to access a dead filesystem.

Allow user to change permissions to another user on the fly, by entering a
password. 'su' requires a tty - do we need an SUID binary?
