This is a quick start guide for people who want to modify the source code.
If you make useful changes or fix bugs, please send patches to me (either
the changed code or a 'diff -crN old new'). Tell me which version you're
using!


COMPILING

The first time you compile the program you need to do 'AppRun --compile', but
in future you only need to run 'make' in the 'src' directory when you change
the .c and .h files.


AUTOCONF

Here's a quick explanation of the autoconf system in case you haven't used it
before. See 'info autoconf' for full details. I've only recently started using
it myself...

There's a file called 'configure.in' which contains various tests ('info m4').
You run 'autoconf' and it reads through the file and generates a shell script
to perform the tests, saving it as 'configure'. 'configure' is normally
distributed with the program because not everyone has autoconf.

You then run 'configure' (in fact, let the 'AppRun' script do it because it
passes it some arguments), which performs all the tests. It reads in
'Makefile.in' and 'config.h.in' and fills in the missing values with the test
results to produce 'Makefile' and 'config.h'.

You run 'make', which creates .o files from the .c files and links to produce
ROX-Filer.
